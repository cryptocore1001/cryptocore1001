### About Me 🚀<br>

 <p align="justify">
Hello, I am an Expert-Vetted, Software Engineer specialization in Conversational AI. <br>
I have expertise with chatbot frameworks, like  Conversational AI RASA, Amazon Alexa, Engati, Twilio, Dialog360, CHATFUEL, Many chat, Landbot.io, chatbot.com, Wati.io and many others.<br>
I have helped companies integrate chatbots with systems already in place for 5+ years. <br>
First I do the integration accordingly for the use case using Python & Flask then help the technical team with the solution.<br>

🚀Chatbot:<br>
 I can develop chatbots for multiple communication channels such as websites, social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram), messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram), SMS, and voice bots. <br>
 I am well-versed in leveraging Webhooks for seamless integration with existing systems.<br>
 I have successfully developed and deployed chatbots across various industries, including airlines, Real Estate, healthcare, dental services, events management, E-commerce and recruitment agencies. <br>
 My experience encompasses web chatbots, WhatsApp chatbots, Facebook chatbots, Telegram bots, voice bots, and SMS chatbots.<br>
    🤩Why Chatbot:<br>
    I Strongly believe, that a chatbot can be a virtual assistant of any business because chatbot can be available 24/7 which will increase customer satisfaction and engagement with your business. <br>
    It means more data will be generated we can use the data for analysis, visualization and API's.<br>
🚀LLM:<br>
 I have been developing applications with OPENAI and Google PALM for the past few months. <br>
 Especially for Extractive/Generative Question & Answering systems for unstructured text data like pdf. docx, website, JSON, google sheet etc.<br>
 I can create a custom chatbot based on that data without much training needed.<br>

🏅Experiences:<br>
✔️Big Data & ML,<br>
By leveraging Apache Spark, I preprocessed the given data, performed the necessary cleaning and feature extraction, and chose the most suitable AI model for the task at hand. <br>
The distributed nature of Apache Spark allows for efficient processing of large datasets, making it a popular choice for big data analytics and machine learning tasks.<br>
✔️Resource-prelimited Chatbot<br>
I developed various integrated ChatGPT projects such as "Proprietary AI" to assist customers with proprietary information(feeding from PDF, XLSX).<br>
Main issue was to build a resourece-predefined Chatbot which answer the info only related to this company.<br>
I've tried prompting and extracting specified data from PDFs, documents, but it was difficult.<br>
After then, I found that solution.<br>
That was great!<br>
✔️AI Crypto Trading<br>
I have some experience with Trading automation using AI.<br>
In the previous work, I worked on the AI-based Go lang project for the trading.<br>
My client gave me a great review.<br>
✔️Image detection<br>
In my previous work, we built a Alcohol-detection system for bad drive.<br>
That project included,  Raspberry Pi hardware (alcohol detection using Q-Alcohol smart sensor, drive sleepy-detection using CCD camera ) and detection software to analysis the data using AI. <br>
That is utilizing broadly to avoid the traffic troubles.<br>
During that project, there were so many difficulties but we struggled into success.<br>
That was perfect.<br>
My role was to integrate the hardware and software(in particular, AI software image detection and processing using TensorFlow).<br>
✔️Own Model<br>
-Input Sanitization<br>
-Syntax Validation<br>
-Query Parameterization<br>
-Domain-Specific Validation<br>
-NLP library:<br>
NLTK <br>
spaCy<br>
-Frame works:<br>
TensorFlow or PyTorch<br>
✔️Data extraction<br>
I was in a data engineer's project.<br>
I have used TensorFlow, padas, numpy, pysimplegui, aqdefreader, and docx python libraries.<br>
Especially, I have analized the qdas files content and ouputed the report for the specific information by using TensorFlow.<br>
It included excel, pdf and doc files with the specific table and graph.<br>
As well as the workflow automatino perfectly completed!<br>
Interpreting the given QDAS file, extraction and statistics from scratch was too difficult, but I did it successfully.  <br>
I can analize all the data including QDAS files by using them.<br>

Feel free to contact me if you need any help.<br>
